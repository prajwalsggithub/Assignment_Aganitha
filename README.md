Project Title: Fetching Pharma Research Papers from PubMed

 Project Description:-

This Python program allows users to search for research papers from PubMed (a trusted database of biomedical research) using any topic or keyword they provide. But here's the special part:

It doesn't just fetch random papers.
It finds papers that include at least one author from a pharmaceutical or biotech company (like Aganitha Cognitive Solutions or Pfizer).  
This helps users **focus only on industry-related research**, rather than academic or university-only studies.

 What the Program Does:=

1. **Takes a search query** like "COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer".
2. **Connects to PubMed** and finds matching research papers.
3. **Analyzes the authors' affiliations** to find non-academic ones (like "Aganitha", "Inc.", "Solutions", etc.).
4. **Filters out purely academic papers**.
5. **Extracts important info**, including:
   - PubMed ID
   - Title
   - Publication Date
   - Non-academic Author(s)
   - Company Name(s)
   - Corresponding Author Email
6. **Saves all of this into a CSV file** so itâ€™s easy to open in Excel or Google Sheets.
